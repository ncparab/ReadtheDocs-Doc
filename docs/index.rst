About ReadTheDocs:-
--------------------

Read the Docs simplifies software documentation by automating building, versioning, and hosting of your docs for you.
Read the Docs is a software documentation hosting platform. The source code is freely available, and the service is also free to use. It generates documentation that is written with the Sphinx documentation generator. The site was created in 2010 by Eric Holscher, Bobby Grace, and Charles Leifer.
According to Alexa, Read the Docs is in the top 1,500 web sites in the world, and the largest open source documentation hosting site.[citation needed
On March 9, 2011 the Python Software Foundation Board awarded a grant of USD $840 to the Read the Docs project for twelve months of hosting fees
On November 13, 2017 the Linux Mint project announced that they are moving their documentation to Read the Docs
Write the Docs, a direct descendant of the Read the Docs project, was created as a conference for Read the Docs users, but has turned into a generic software documentation community.

Requirements:-
--------------

First, obtain Python 2.7 and virtualenv if you do not already have them. Using a virtual environment is strongly recommended, since it will help you to avoid clutter in your system-wide libraries.
Additionally Read the Docs depends on:

- Git (version >=2.20.0)

- Mercurial (only if you need to work with mercurial repositories)

- Pip (version >1.5)

- Redis

- Elasticsearch (only if you want full support for searching inside the site)
